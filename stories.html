							<h2>Reflections: First Co-op</h2>
							<button type="button">Show</button>
							<h4>Aug 27 2017</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="panel">
							<p>As I approach the end of my first co-op, I think it would be best to write a reflection of what has happened in the past four months. Right now, I bet you’re probably expecting me to write something about the company that I worked at or the job that I did during these few months.</p>

							<p>But, that’s not what I’m going to do for this reflection.</p>

							<p>I feel like although I did acquire a good deal of technical and soft skills throughout this work term, that’s not what I will be writing about. This is because I feel like the main impact that this co-op term made in my life was not work or career-related. Surprisingly, it was personal.</p>

							<p>The past several years of my life has been somewhat insane. What I mean is that a lot has happened and changed throughout these few years. A lot of good things happened and lot of happy memories were made. However, a lot of bad events have occurred as well. 2013-2014 was by far one of the worst high school years I have ever experienced. 2014-2015 was also a pretty bad school year, but not as bad as the previous one. I do not want to go into details with what happened, but let’s just say the culture at my previous high school grew somewhat toxic for me. 2015-2016 was both a good and a bad school year. It was the time when I moved to Canada. Although I met a lot of good friends during that year, made tons of weird and awesome memories, and learned A LOT of life lessons, it was still pretty stressful, mostly due to the fact that I put a lot of pressure on myself to get into a good university. Adapting to the new culture and forcing myself to grow up, be independent, and speak on my own were some struggles I experienced that year as well. After graduating from secondary school, I thought that this was it. I thought that I can finally be happy and settle down. But, no, that’s not what happened. First-year university struck me hard. I was not struggling academically, but I was struggling to get my first co-op, and I was relentlessly fighting so hard to get a job in Canada. On top of that, I had all these doubts about the program I was in, which took a pretty huge toll on my overall mental health. The fact that my university temporarily halted program transfers did not help at all. Finally, I ended up getting a job nearly into the co-op term.</p>

							<p>I finally had the chance to breathe.</p>

							<p>During this work term, I had the chance to re-think about my life and my future goals. I had the chance to relax and not worry about my grades or about whether or not I was eligible to transfer into the program that I wanted. I had the chance to get back to doing the things I do for fun. I had the chance to finally catch up on sleep and fix my sleeping schedule. I had the chance to meet people outside of my cohort and outside of my university. The best part was I had the chance to earn my own money for the first time in my life and pay for my own expenses by myself. I felt human again. I was not under much pressure. After 4 years of stress, I was able to relax. This was what made this term special. I feel very re-energized and refreshed now.</p>

							<p>Throughout this summer, I finished a project, surrendered my pursuit of the Iron Ring (finally), learned a few new programming languages, expanded my music library, learned to cook and buy my own groceries, got my Ontario driver’s license after much procrastination, developed better grooming habits (a.k.a. tried out different hairstyles lol), and (ayyy really proud of this one, wait for it…)  went back to lifting, this time, with a far better and a way more balanced routine (simultaneously realizing how dumb my 16-year-old self was). Doing all these things made me feel alive again and made me realize that my life was not just my career or my academics.</p>

							<p>My perspectives on life have changed throughout these four months. I’m not too keen on returning to Waterloo now, but we all have to sacrifice and suffer a little bit to get to better places in life. All that’s left for me to do right now is hope for the best for my next school term and not fail anything. </p>
