									<li><h3>1. <strong>Personal Website & Blogs</strong> (You're looking at it right now!!) : </h3>

										<p>The idea for this project was simple. I wanted to make a personal website <em>unlike</em> other CS,SE,ECE, etc. students in UW. I wanted to make one that was <strong>actually</strong> personal. The purpose of this website is to show-case the real me outside of my career and my academics. I wanted to show people what I love to do after working/studying.</p>

										<p>This site is created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript <strong style="color: red;">from scratch</strong>. I used <strong style="color: maroon;">no frameworks or libraries</strong> (with the exception of jQuery) for this site <strong style="color:green;">on purpose</strong>, to attain a better understanding of front-end development.</p>

										<p>Overall, I am pretty proud of this project because I ended up growing my knowledge of front-end development as well as a little bit of back-end development.</p>

										<ul>Technologies I used: <br>
											<li>HTML5 - content</li>
											<li>CSS3 - styling</li>
											<li>JavaScript & jQuery - interactivity and client-side input validation</li>
											<li>PHP - form validation, processing, mailing features</li>
											<li>XAMPP - Apache local server</li>
										</ul><br />
										<ul>Main obstacles I faced: <br>
											<li>Writing and debugging JS and using jQuery whilst still being fairly new to them.</li>
											<li>Learning server-side development with PHP.</li>
											<li>WAMP server not starting and major difficulties configuring SendMail (SMTP) (for sending e-mails through forms).</li>
										</ul>
									</li><br>
									<li><h3>2. WIPEOUT! Automated Runway Sweeper:</h3>

										<p>This project, I'd have to admit, was a group project for a course. Before transferring, I was in Mechatronics Engineering. This robotics project was for my introductory programming course GENE121 in 1A.</p>

										<p>What this robot does is that it sweeps debris off of a miniature model of an airport runway. It features a <strong style="color:dark blue;">line-following algorithm</strong> that made use of simple programming concepts (think loops and if-statements). Intuitively, using basic (like basic basic) CS concepts, a line-following algorithm would probably feature a loop, where if the sensor sees white (a boolean value), then continue, and if the sensor sees black, then turn left/right to correct the robot's path. This algorithm turned out to be inefficient and inaccurate as the robot will end up zig-zagging. Instead, the line-following algorithm goes something like this: <span style="color:#648880;"> 1. I am going to make the light sensor see the <em>edge</em> of the line where it is 50% black and 50% white. 2.If I see more black than white, I will make a correction left or right based on how much more black I've seen. 3. I'll do the same if I see more white. </span> This way, the robot will not zig-zag and will follow the line more accurately.</p>

										<ul>Technologies I used: <br>
											<li>RobotC - C/C++ based robot programming language for NXT and VEX robotics</li>
											<li>[Hardware] NXT light sensors, motors, encoders, and a programmable brick microcomputer </li>
										</ul><br>

										<h3>3. Lyric Logger, Online To-Do List [lightweight]:</h3>
										<p>These projects are my very initial ventures into web development.</p>
										<p>For some reason, my first website that I ever made ever was in Django, which is very odd, I know. It was a lyric logger, which is a web application that allows songwriters to create an account to save their lyrical ideas online. It ended up being a website with a bunch of forms. It was a little bit lame, but I did get to familiarize myself with some back-end concepts (requests/responses, GET/POST requests, data models, primary & foreign keys, etc.)</p>
										<ul>Technologies I used:
											<li>Django framework in Python</li>
											<li>Heroku (for Deployment)</li>
											<li>Git</li>
											<li>Twitter Bootstrap</li>
										</ul>

										<ul>Obstacles I faced:
											<li>Since prior to this I had 0 knowledge about web development, everything...<li>
										</ul>

										<p>My second website (which remains undeployed) is an online to-do list. I still don’t think this project was a success but I got a better understanding of HTML & CSS nonetheless from this project.</p>

										<ul>Technologies I used:
											<li>NodeJS & Express</li>
											<li>MongoDB</li>
											<li>Git, HTML, CSS, JS/jQuery</li>
										</ul>

										<ul>Obstacles I faced:
											<li>The lack of documentation for NodeJS (since it’s still new) made it difficult to debug the code.</li>
											<li>Learning how non-relational databases (and databases in general) work.</li>
										</ul>
